Olympic Games Data Analysis

This project is a hands-on exploratory data analysis (EDA) exercise aimed at mastering Python-based data analysis tools, including Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

Project Overview

This analysis is based on the 120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to extract meaningful insights, visualize trends, and enhance data manipulation skills through various techniques. The questions explored in this project are designed to foster learning and experimentation.

The dataset has been pre-downloaded and extracted into the data directory, eliminating the need for additional downloads after cloning this repository.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run the analysis, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

Numpy - for numerical computations

Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib - for data visualization

The easiest way to install these dependencies is by using Anaconda, which comes preloaded with essential data science libraries. The project is developed using Python 3.
