# 🏅 Olympic Games Data Analysis

This project is a hands-on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** exercise aimed at mastering Python-based data analysis tools, including `Pandas`, `Numpy`, and `Matplotlib`.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis is based on the **[120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home)** dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective is to:

- 📈 Extract meaningful insights
- 🎯 Visualize trends
- 🛠 Enhance data manipulation skills through various techniques

The dataset is pre-downloaded and available in the `data` directory, eliminating the need for additional downloads after cloning this repository.
